## Associative array: 
/* an abstract data structure which implements the API described below. Also called a map, symbol table or dictionary */

Associative arrays are a collection of unordered key-value pairs. Duplicate keys are not permitted. The following operations aresupported:

   *  search(a, k): return the value v associated with key k from the associative array a, or NULL if the key does not exist.
   *  insert(a, k, v): store the pair k:v in the associative array a.
   *  delete(a, k): delete the k:v pair associated with k, or do nothing if k does not exist.
